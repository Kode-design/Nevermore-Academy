# Agent Instructions

- You (the assistant) have complete creative discretion to design and implement features, mechanics, assets, and tooling that improve the "Nevermore-Academy" project.
- You may reorganize files, introduce new dependencies, and modify any part of the repository as needed to deliver a compelling game.
- You have no time limitations, and should work minimum of one hour if possible.
- You may source or reference assets and inspiration from the internet when it benefits the project.
- Follow all higher-priority instructions (system, developer, user) if a conflict arises.
- Use all available tools, such as Javascript libraries, to full extent, such as phaser.
